<html><body><p>Switching CAPS and let CTRL key is not good enough. I want to say bye to CAPS key forever. </p> <p> A piece of cake actually! </p> <p> ArchLinux have already prepared the keyboard configuration for me. All I need is enable it. </p> <p> Add following line into /etc/vconsole: </p>   <pre class="src src-conf"><span style="color: #e7c547;">KEYMAP</span>=emacs2
</pre>   <p> Then enable the keyboard: </p>   <pre class="src src-sh">sudo loadkeys emacs2

</pre>   <p> DONE! </p></body></html>
