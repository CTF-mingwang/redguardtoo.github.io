<html><body><p>I have 168 packages installed through Emacs package manager. And I shared my <a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d">emacs.d at github</a>. </p> <p> So these days I have been spending much time on solve the issues for people who use my .emacs.d. </p> <p> The root cause of most issues is the packages downloaded from <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net">melpa</a> are not stable enough. </p> <p> That's understandable because packages hosted at melpa are built automatically from developers' git repositories. </p> <p> Now here is my solution: </p><ol> <li>I use more stable packages from other repositories if possible. </li> <li>I use whitelist to explicitly list the packages I want to install from melpa. </li> </ol>   <p> White list because although packages on non-melpa are more stable, there are still some exceptions. </p> <p> For example, the package "erlang" exists both in melpa and <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">marmalade</a>. But only the version at melpa is usable. </p> <p> Now I need show you the code. See my <a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/blob/master/init-elpa.el">init-elpa.el</a> at github for configuration. Especially the code related to variable "melpa-include-package". </p></body></html>
