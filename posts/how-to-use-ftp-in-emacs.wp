<html><body><p>Emacs's default <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/AngeFtp">Ftp client</a> is a little outdated compared to other modern Ftp clients. </p> <p> What I want is a two panel file explorer with ftp client integrated (An excellent example is <a href="http://www.ghisler.com">Total Commander</a> on windows). </p> <p> In Emacs, I've got <a href="http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander">Sunrise Commander</a> which is close to Total Commander, but NO Ftp integration. </p> <p> I dig around the internet for a while and find that the perfect solution is mount the ftp server into my local file system with <a href="http://curlftpfs.sourceforge.net">CurlFtpFS</a>. </p> <p> The best part of this solution is CurlFtpFS supports both OS X and Linux. </p> <p> In order to install CurlFtpFS on OS X, you need use the package manager <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>. The only catch I met on OS X is that I need upgrade Fuse4X driver manually for some wired reason to avoid "incompatible with the kernel version" error. Upgrading is simple. Download dmg plus mouse click stuff only. See <a href="http://fuse4x.github.com/faq.html">FAQ</a> for details. </p> <p> For the usage of CurlFtpFS, see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mount_FTP">HERE</a> for documentation. It's for Linux. But totally fine for OS X users. </p></body></html>
