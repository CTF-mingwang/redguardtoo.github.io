<html><body><p>I <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/448">met some issue</a> when using helm several days ago. </p> <p> With the help from Michael Heerdegen, I can locate the line error message is dumped. </p> <p> But the problem is I cannot get the backtrace at all. </p> <p> So I insert some <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Internals-of-Debugger.html">backtrace printing code</a> above that line and "M-x eval-buffer": </p>

</pre>


   <p> It turns out that some third party package I installed changes the emacs variable "display-buffer-function". I guess that's why the backtrace is blocked. Because backtrace is usually dumped into a backtrace buffer. And backtrace buffer's is actually influenced by the variable. </p></body></html>
