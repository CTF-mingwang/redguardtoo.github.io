<html><body><p>I have spent many years on improving my shell (bash, actually) skills. So even I'm doing almost all my jobs in Emacs these day, I still want to use my favorite bash tips and tool if they can be integrated with Emacs seamlessly. </p> <p> The Emacs terminator simulator <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTerm">Ansi Term</a> meets all my needs. You can check <a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/blob/master/init-term-mode.el">my configuration</a> and the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTermHints">EmacsWiki</a> for the tips. </p> <p> There is only one issue left. In my work, I need copy the output of my cool program which executed in ansi-term and paste it elsewhere. How I selected that output in ansi-term effectively? </p> <p> If you read the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Term-Mode.html">Emacs manual</a>, you know you can "M-x term-line-mode" to switch to term-line-mode to begin to select text. After finish the text selection in term-line-mode, you can restore to the original mode by "M-x term-char-mode". </p> <p> That's not efficient enough. Besides, I can not memorize who's who and the corresponding hot keys anyway. </p> <p> My solution is simple. I install <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">evil-mode</a>. Then I press C-z to toggle on vim simulator in ansi-term. That's ALL. I can press C-z again to toggle off the vim simulator. </p> <p> Now I have the full power of Vi on selecting,searching, filtering, yanking text. </p></body></html>
