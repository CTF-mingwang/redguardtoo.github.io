<html><body><p>It's too hard to get code from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitorious">gitorious</a>. I tried `git clone` from gitorious's server for half an hour and failed. My similar operation on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Github">github</a> usually succeeded (I am at Shanghai/China). I would not panic if I could copy code from its web page. And I couldn't! Gitorious screwed up my clipboard by <a href="https://gitorious.org/robmyers/scripts/blobs/master/artbollocks-mode.el">mixing the line number in</a>! Horrible frontend UI design. <a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/blob/master/init-auto-complete.el">Select/copy code is easy</a> at github is easy. </p></body></html>
