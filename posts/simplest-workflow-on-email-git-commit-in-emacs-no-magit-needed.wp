<html><body><p>Sometimes I just want to email my trivial patch to the original author and forget it. In this case "github fork" or "git format-patch" is too heavy weight for me. </p> <p> So here is the simplest workflow I can figure out: </p><ul> <li>Step 1, command "M-x vc-dir" whose hotkey is "C-x v d" </li> <li>Step 2, command "M-x git-print-log" whose hotkey is "C-x v l" </li> <li>Step 3, Move focus to the specific commit and run command "M-x log-view-diff" whose hotkey is "d". </li> <li>Step 4, Yank the commit/diff </li> <li>Step 5, Compose new email (command "M-x compose-mail" whose hotkey is "C-x m") </li> <li>Step 6, Make sure the subject of email start with "[PATCH]". See <a href="http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Development:_How_to_submit_patches">this patch sumbit guide</a> for reasons. </li> <li>Step 7, Paste the content of commit/diff into email body. </li> <li>Step 8, Send the email by command "M-x message-send-and-exit" whose hotkey is "C-c C-c" </li> </ul>   <p> Please note: </p><ul> <li>Step 1 is usually necessary unless you only need the diff of current file. </li> <li>Step 2 and step 3 could be replaced with command "M-x vc-diff" or hotkey "C-x v =" if you want to email the diff of work directory. </li> </ul>  </body></html>
