set statusline=%-10.3n  "buffer number

  <p> The purpose of above two lines is to display buffer number at the status line of vim. It's OPTIONAL. You don't need see the buffer number is you are familiar with the all the buffer's position. The left top is buffer number 2. The middle top is buffer number 3. The right top is buffer number 4. </p> <p> Second, if you know the buffer number, you can use hot key like ",2" (press comma first, then press two key as quickly as possible) to pull change from buffer number 2. Add below code into your ~/.vimrc to set up hot keys: </p>   


<pre class="prettyprint ">

map &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;2 :diffget 2&lt;CR&gt; :diffupdate&lt;CR&gt;

   <p> Git will invoke vimdiff with the following window layout. There are four buffers in this layout: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wpid-git-merge-tool-nq8.png" alt="http://blog.binchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wpid-git-merge-tool-nq8.png"> </p> <p> Here is the explanation of each buffer: </p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides"> <caption></caption> <colgroup><col class="left"><col class="left"><col class="right"> </colgroup> <thead> <tr><th scope="col" class="left">Buffer</th><th scope="col" class="left">Explanation</th><th scope="col" class="right">Buffer Number</th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td class="left">THEIRS (LOCAL)</td><td class="left">contents of the file on the current branch</td><td class="right">2</td></tr> <tr><td class="left">BASE</td><td class="left">common base for the merge</td><td class="right">3</td></tr> <tr><td class="left">YOURS (REMOTE)</td><td class="left">contents of the file to be merged.</td><td class="right">4</td></tr> <tr><td class="left">MERGED</td><td class="left">The file containing the conflict markers. You need edit and commit this file.</td><td class="right">1</td></tr> </tbody> </table>   <p> Some people name THEIRS and YOURS buffer to LOCAL and REMOTE buffer. That's totally fine because names are just names. The point is that the top middle buffer is the BASE one which contains the original code before Bob and Chen committing any code. And the bottom buffer is the mess which contains resolved/unresolved conflicts where you actual editing work happens. </p> <p> You could press hot key ",2" (comma + two), Then you pick the content from THEIRS buffer (the top left buffer). It means you will use the Bob's code and discard Chen's code in MERGED buffer. </p> <p> You could press hot key ",3" (comma + three), Then you pick the content from BASE buffer (the top middle buffer). It means you will discard either Bob's code or Chen's code in MERGED buffer. </p> <p> You could press hot key ",4" (comma + four), Then you pick the content from YOURS buffer (the top right buffer). It means you will use Chen's code and discard Bob code in MERGED buffer. </p> <p> Or you can edit the content directly in MERGED buffer. Anyway, git only care about the file binding to MERGED buffer. Any other buffer will be ignored by git. </p> <p> You can use hot key "[c language=" and "][/c]c" to navigate to previous/next conflict (including the conflict resolved by git automatically) in current file which is binding to MERGED buffer. </p> <p> After finishing editing of the conflicting file in MERGED buffer, you can use hot key ":xa" to exit vimdiff. Git will open next conflicting file with vimdiff automatically. </p> <p> When you have resolved all the conflicts, follow the hint of git to commit your changes. </p> </div>  </div>  <div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-3"> <h3 id="sec-6">Tips</h3> <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6">  <ul> <li>A vim plugin called fugitive.vim (<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive</a>) can do this too. Actually it can do much more git stuff than merge. I cannot write this article without reading its code. </li> <li>You can use Emacs to do the similar job (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1817370/using-ediff-as-git-mergetool">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1817370/using-ediff-as-git-mergetool</a>). For me, Emacs start up time is too much for this task. Some people use emacsclient which has other overhead which I don't like. </li> <li>If you prefer merge tool with GUI, you can use command line `git mergetool -t gvimdiff` instead. </li> <li>The ":diffget" command is valid if and only if there are <b>MARKED</b> conflicts in merged buffer. If there are <b>NOT</b> any marked string like "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;" or "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;" around current change (you can jump to previous/next change by press "[c language=" or "][/c]c"), it means the git have automatically resolved potential conflict for you. Review this kind of change is still wise because git is not as smart as human. </li> <li>If you prefer navigating between the unresolved conflicts <b>only</b>, you can install Tim Pope's <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">vim-unimpaired</a> and use hot key "[n" and "]n" to do the navigation. </li> <li>I map "[n" and "]n" to more handy hot keys: </li> </ul>

map &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;2 :diffget 2&lt;CR&gt; :diffupdate&lt;CR&gt;

   <p> Then you can press hot key ",2" ",3" ",4" in vimdiff to pull change from top three buffer. The bottom buffer is for editing the code with markers which is actually your only work space. </p> <p> ":help vimdiff" for other hot keys. </p> </div> </div> </body></html>
