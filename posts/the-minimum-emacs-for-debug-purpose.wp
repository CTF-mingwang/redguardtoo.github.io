<html><body><p>I've installed <a href="https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d">more than 100 emacs plugins</a>. </p> <p> Since I publicized my .emacs at github, lots of people have copied my configuration. Now it becomes my obligation to solve all the plugin compatibility issue reported by my users. </p> <p> To solve the issue, I need a minimum .emacs for testing the plugin. </p> <p> So here is my minimum .emacs, </p>

   <p> The code is straight forward. I scan any sub-directories in ~/test-elisp and add them into load-path. I also add URLs of third party repositories so that I can download and install packages from internet conviniently. </p> <p> I also upload the .emacs to dropbox, so you can use one bash liner to download it: </p>   


<pre class="prettyprint ">

cd ~/;wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/858862/emacs/.emacs;mkdir -p ~/test-elisp;
