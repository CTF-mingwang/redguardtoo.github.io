<html><body><p>WARNING, this is BAD practice. I'm showing you anti-pattern you'd better avoid. </p> <p> The work flow is simple at the beginning. There is only one master branch where several developers submit the code. </p> <p> Then come bad rules:  </p><ul> <li>Rule 1, any feature should be done on new branch (this rule is actually good if without next three rules)  </li> <li>Rule 2, `git rebase` is forbidden and any minor branch created by developers should be publicized immediately.  </li> <li>Rule 3, keep using your same feature branch forever even it's behind master branch for a very long time.   </li> <li>Rule 4, `git merge` between feature and master branches frequently </li> </ul>   <p> After three months developement, this is the result of `git log –graph –oneline`: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/git-merge-mess-nq82.png" alt="image/git-merge-mess-nq8.png"> </p> <p> Can you see the "M" at the top right corner. It's "M" from "Merge". </p></body></html>
