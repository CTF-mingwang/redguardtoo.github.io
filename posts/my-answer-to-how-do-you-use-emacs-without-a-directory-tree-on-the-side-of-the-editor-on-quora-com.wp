Please note I focus on programming for large projects. I need search/grep/modify files scattered in different places without documentation. </p> <p> If your use case is different, a embedded file explorer may be a better choice </p>  <div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-3"> <h3 id="sec-1">Tools I use to replace a file explorer</h3> <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1">  <ol> <li>ido-find-file (emacs), just type any characters, it will fuzz search matched file in parent/sibling/current/or-whatever directory.  </li> <li>helm-find-file (emacs), this one use regular expression and has bigger window  </li> <li>recentf and helm (emacs), I use regular expression open recent opened files.  </li> <li>ctags, gtags or whatever tag tools (CLI tool), as mentioned by other people  </li> <li>I also use lots of bash functions written by myself, those functions are trivial, but combined with a wonderful tool called percol, they become really powerful.  </li> <li>I use some CLI clipboard tool so I can easily share the file path between terminal/emacs/firefox.  </li> <li>there is also a emacs bundled feature called speedbar, which is similar to the file explorer, I used it once, but it does not fit in my ninja style ;) It's fine but the UI is almost same to those average text editors.  </li> <li>I also write some elisp snippets, for example, convert absolute path to relative path; given one relative path, output one absolute path, etc …  </li> <li>there is also some git based emacs plugin: you can search file under the project root directory.  </li> <li>there is a CLI tool called fasd which can let you interactively select the file or folder you recently visited.  </li> <li>many other tools, plug-ins, code snippets I can use … </li> </ol>   </div>  </div>  <div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-3"> <h3 id="sec-2">Use case</h3> <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2">  <ol> <li>I need search a big project for a certain library (it's a freemarker file I need include) whose full path I don't know, I just search the API's name by type: </li> </ol>  <p>"gef keyword *". gef is my bash function based on grep. </p><ol> <li>matched files are displayed instantly (grep is much more quick than IDEs, BTW) in a interactive console filter (use percol), I type a regular expression to filter file name and press enter </li> <li>the full path is in clipboard now, then I type ":e Shift-insert" to open that file. </li> </ol>  <p>This is the most difficult case, I usually strike less keys and not get out of Emacs. </p><ol> <li>If i need insert this file's relative path, I press a hot key and another emacs plugin will correctly convert absolute path to relative one (relative to the file I'm editing in Emacs) and insert it into my editor. </li> </ol>   </div>  </div>  <div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-3"> <h3 id="sec-3">Demo</h3> <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3">  <p>Here is screen cast. In this demo I grepped and open a ftl file and then search another js file in the same project. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wpid-emacs-grep-search-open-file.gif" alt="http://blog.binchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wpid-emacs-grep-search-open-file.gif"> </p></div> </div> </body></html>
