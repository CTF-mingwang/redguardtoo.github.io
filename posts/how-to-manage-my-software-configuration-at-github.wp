My commit history looks not linear. </p> </div>  </div>  <div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-3"> <h3 id="sec-2">Solution</h3> <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2">  <p>Simple. I need use `git pull â€“rebase origin master` instead of `git pull origin master` </p> <p> Rebase will usually rewrite my commit history at your <b>local branch</b>. It's totally fine because I won't share the software configuration on my local computer. If I want to share my configuration, I will use the public url at github. </p></div> </div> </body></html>
