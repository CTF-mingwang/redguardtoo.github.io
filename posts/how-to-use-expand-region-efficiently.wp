<html><body><p><a href="https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el">expand-region.el</a> is very useful plugin. I use it to select a code segment and keep press its expand key until the selected region expand to the desired region. </p> <p> The only issue is it's recommended hot key for command "er/expand-region" is "C-=". A little bit hard to press. </p> <p> After marking a region by pressing "C-=", I need press "=" to expand region and "-" to contract region. </p> <p> As you may notice, to press "=" or "-" keys I need move my right hand. </p> <p> Myh solution is kind of simple, you press ",xx" to select initial region. Keep press "x" to expand. "z" to contract region. </p> <p> All you need is using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">evil-mode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader">evil-leader</a>. </p> <p> Here is my elisp code: </p>   


<pre class="prettyprint ">

(require 'evil)

(require 'evil-leader)

(evil-mode 1) ;; enable evil-mode



(eval-after-load "evil" '(setq expand-region-contract-fast-key "z"))

(evil-leader/set-key "xx" 'er/expand-region)
</pre>
