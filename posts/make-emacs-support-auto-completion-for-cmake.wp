<html><body><p>Easy. You only install company-mode and company-cmake.el according to the documentation <a href="https://github.com/company-mode/company-cmake">HERE</a>. </p> <p> company-cmake.el is written by me. I'm in the process of signing necessary copyright papers to make it part of company-mode. I was told the process could take one month because I'm deal with GNU foundation. So please be patient. </p> <p> Anyway, you can use company-cmake.el right now with company-mode without any problem. </p> <p> Please note I only tested this plugin with cmake 2.8. </p> <p> Here is screen shot: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/company-cmake-nq8.png" alt="http://blog.binchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/company-cmake-nq8.png"> </p> <p> UPDATED (12th Jan, 2014): Legal procedure is done. Now company-cmake.el is officially part of company-mode since version 0.6.12. </p> <p> So all you need to do is install latest company-mode, no other set up required! </p></body></html>
