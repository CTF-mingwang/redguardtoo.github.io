<html><body><p><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog">org2blog</a> will post items in org-mode into wordpress blog. </p> <p> It makes the Emacs best blog writer in the world. </p> <p> My only issue is after publishing the blog, how can I share the blog url to social network sites. </p> <p> So I write a function which will automatically put the article's permanent url into clipboard: </p>   


<pre class="prettyprint ">

(defun my-org2blog-post-subtree ()
  (interactive)
  ;; go to the top node which is a blog item
  ;;(outline-up-heading)

  ;; post and publish
  (org2blog/wp-post-subtree t)
  (let* ((postid (or (org-entry-get (point) "POSTID")
                     (org-entry-get (point) "POST_ID")))
         (url org2blog/wp-server-xmlrpc-url))
    (if (not postid)
        (message "This subtree hasn't been posted, yet.")
      (setq url (substring url 0 -10))
      (setq url (concat url "?p=" postid ))
      (kill-new url)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert url)
        (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                 (cond
                                  ((eq system-type 'cygwin) "putclip")
                                  ((eq system-type 'darwin) "pbcopy")
                                  (t "xsel -ib")
                                  )))
      (message (concat url " =&gt; clipboard"))
      )))
</pre>


   <p> BTW, use some clipboard manager to synchronize the X clipboards. </p></body></html>
